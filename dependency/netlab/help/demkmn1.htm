Synopsis

<p><h2>
Description
</h2>
The problem consists of data in a two-dimensional space. 
The data is
drawn from three spherical Gaussian distributions with priors 0.3,
0.5 and 0.2; centres (2, 3.5), (0, 0) and (0,2); and standard deviations
0.2, 0.5 and 1.0. The first figure contains a
scatter plot of the data.  The data is the same as in <CODE>demgmm1</CODE>.

<p>A cluster model with three components is trained using the batch
K-means algorithm. The matrix of centres is printed after training.
The second
figure shows the data labelled with a colour derived from the corresponding 
cluster
